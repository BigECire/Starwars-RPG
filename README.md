When you open up this page, you get to choose one of four StarWar characters to be your character.

From this point, you will have to use that character in order to beat the other three.  The real strategy, in this game, comes from picking in which order you will fight your opponents.  In order for you to win, you must get all your opponents’ health to zero.  You will lose if your character’s health gets to zero.
